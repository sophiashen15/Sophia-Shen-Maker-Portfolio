# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of core data structures and advanced projects implemented in Java.

## Core Data Structures

**Linked List Implementations**
- `int_linked_list.java` - Integer-specific singly linked list
- `doubly_linked_list.java` - Generic doubly linked list with bidirectional traversal

**Array-Based Structures**
- `dynamic_array.java` - Resizable array with automatic capacity management
- `ordered_array_int_set.java` - Sorted array-based integer set
- `unordered_array_int_set.java` - Unsorted array-based integer set

**Tree Structures**
- `int_binary_search_tree.java` - Integer binary search tree with recursive operations
- `tree_int_set.java` - Tree-based integer set implementation

**Hash-Based Structures**
- `mod_table_int_set.java` - Hash table using modular arithmetic
- `int_set.java` - Abstract integer set interface

## Featured Sub-Projects
