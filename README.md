# Sophia Shen – Maker Portfolio

Welcome to my maker portfolio! This repository brings together projects that showcase my interests in algorithms, data structures, transportation systems, and full-stack app development. Each folder represents a different area of exploration, from theoretical computer science to applied transportation engineering.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `aeromile`

**Description:** A routing algorithm for last-mile delivery integrating trucks and drones.

**Highlights:**
- Developed algorithms to minimize delivery time and emissions
- Worked with route optimization, travel time data, and CO₂ reduction models

### 2. `prform_app`

**Description:** A React + Tailwind CSS app for Prform, a wearable device startup concept that combines hardware sensors with software for real-time movement analysis.

**Highlights:**
- Full-stack web app with React, Tailwind, and PostCSS
- Organized into `public/` and `src/` directories with main entry points like `app.jsx`
- Demonstrates frontend development, responsive design, and startup-oriented product thinking

### 3. `data structures and algs`

**Description:** Implementations of classic data structures and algorithms in Python.

**Highlights:**
- Covers both fundamental and advanced algorithms:
  - **Trees:** `AVL_tree.py`, `binary_search_tree.py`, `binomial_heap.py`
  - **Graphs:** `graph.py`, `dijkstra_alg.py`, `depth_first_search.py`
  - **Algorithmic paradigms:** `divide_and_conquer.py`, `karatsuba_multiplication.py`, `minimal_spanning_tree_kruskal.py`, `n_queens.py`
- Emphasizes algorithmic problem solving and coding fluency

### 4. `java`

**Description:** A collection of Java implementations of data structures and algorithms.

**Highlights:**
- Includes core structures like `linked_list.java`, `dynamic_array.java`, `int_binary_search_tree.java`, and `hash_tables`
- Sub-projects:
  - **Huffman Encoding:** compression algorithm implementation
  - **Random Writer:** text generation using probabilistic modeling
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming and algorithm design in Java

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** Implemented in both Python and Java
- **Applied Optimization:** Routing algorithms for transportation logistics
- **Full-Stack Development:** React, Tailwind, PostCSS
- **Problem Solving:** From theoretical (n-queens, spanning trees) to real-world (last-mile delivery, wearable tech)
