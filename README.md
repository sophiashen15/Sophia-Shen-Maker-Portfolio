# Sophia Shen â€“ Maker Portfolio

Welcome to my maker portfolio! This repository contains projects that showcase my work in algorithms, data structures, routing systems, and full-stack app development. The work spans from theoretical computer science to applied transportation engineering.

## Repo Structure

### 1. `aeromile`

**Description:** A routing algorithm for last-mile delivery integrating trucks and drones.

**Highlights:**
- Developed algorithms to reduce delivery time and CO2 emissions
- Worked with Amazon data on routes, driving time, travel time, and packages

### 2. `prform_app`

**Description:** A React + Tailwind CSS app for PRFORM, a wearable device startup concept that combines hardware sensors with software for real-time movement analysis.

**Highlights:**
- Full-stack web app with React, Tailwind, and PostCSS
- Frontend development and responsive design

### 3. `data structures and algs`

**Description:** Implementations of classic data structures and advanced algorithms in Python.

**Highlights:**
- **Trees:** `AVL_tree.py`, `binary_search_tree.py`, `binomial_heap.py`
- **Graphs:** `graph.py`, `dijkstra_alg.py`, `depth_first_search.py`
- **Algorithms:** `divide_and_conquer.py`, `karatsuba_multiplication.py`, `minimal_spanning_tree_kruskal.py`, `n_queens.py`

### 4. `java`

**Description:** Java implementations of data structures and algorithms.

**Highlights:**
- Includes core structures like `linked_list.java`, `dynamic_array.java`, `int_binary_search_tree.java`, and `hash_tables`
- Sub-projects:
  - **Huffman Encoding:** Compression algorithm implementation
  - **Random Writer:** Markov chain text generation that analyzes character sequences and generates probabilistic text output (levels 0-10 analysis)
